A bridge between Minecraft servers and 3rd party services to enhance the whitelist experience.

To be more specific, this plugin allows users to effectively whitelist themselves via
***Auth Providers***, which are 3rd party services that dictate how a player logs in,
and ***Player Providers***, which dictate how a player is whitelisted.
